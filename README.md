This was a really fun way to be able to combine flex and solidify my grid skills. Implementing SVGs was a hurdle I spent a while trying to get over. For a while I was trying to get them to work as background images, but then they couldn't be easily styled. I ended up just putting them in the HTML file. 

When I first started learning CSS I tended to use margin all the time, but padding really came through for  me in this project. Made everything have a nice amount of whitespace to it. 

I tried to keep my icon/font sizes the same, but I felt it was hard to keep track of everything. I feel like this is somewhere that SCSS/SASS could really shine in creating reusable things for styling, but I'll get to that in the future. 

Next is more JS!

Just in case - I don't own Spongebob. Don't sue me pls :D
